The goal of this homework is to be able to clean a set of codes in a website and arrange it with HTML semantic tags and make it function and flow a lot smoother than before.

This is a list of the following fixes I have made:

## HTML

* Edited the title into a more workable name other than "Website"
* Removed div class="header" to make more semantic with just using Header tag
* Indicate navigation links with Nav tag
* Spaced out and divided each section into a more manageable parting
* Removed unecessary classes and renamed with more clearly defined semantic elements within HTML5 standards
* Added alt attributes to images with  descriptive phrases
* Removed a " < / img> code unecessarily placed
* Established and edited a footer for the webpage

## CSS

* Added comments on all lines of code to describe each line
* Edited .header and .div into header and nav
* Adjusted and condensed all attributes that can be coupled with the rest of the information within the same semantic tag
